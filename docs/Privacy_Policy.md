## Introduction

MySpotiFIX ("we," "our," or "us") developed by Tannenberg Apps is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application MySpotiFIX – Collect Your Favorite Spots (the "App").

## Information We Collect

We only collect and store the information necessary to provide the app's core functionality. All data collection happens only through your explicit actions inside the app.

### Automatically Collected Information

- **Device Information**: Device model, operating system version, and app version
- **Usage Data**: How you interact with the App (anonymized)

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:
- **Provide Core Functionality**: Save, organize, and display your favorite places
- **Enable Navigation**: Integrate with mapping services (Google Maps, Waze, Apple Maps)
- **Facilitate Sharing**: Allow you to share location information with others
- **Backup & Sync**: Enable data backup and restoration
- **Improve the App**: Analyze usage patterns to enhance user experience

## Data Storage and Security

The app does not transmit your personal location data to our servers. All location-related data remains on your device unless you explicitly back it up or share it.

### Local Storage
- Your location data is primarily stored locally on your device
- Photos and notes are stored in the app's secure local database
- You maintain full control over your data

### Cloud Backup (Optional)
- If you choose to enable backup, encrypted data may be stored securely
- Backups are encrypted and accessible only to you
- You can disable cloud backup at any time

### Security Measures
- Data encryption both in transit and at rest
- Secure authentication protocols
- Regular security updates and monitoring

## Data Sharing

### We DO NOT Share Your Personal Data With Third Parties For:
- Advertising purposes
- Marketing campaigns
- Data selling or monetization

### We May Share Data Only When:
- **You Choose to Share**: When you actively share a location with friends
- **Legal Requirements**: If required by law or legal process
- **Safety Concerns**: To prevent harm or illegal activities

### Third-Party Services
- **Mapping Services**: Location data is shared with mapping apps (Google Maps, Waze) only when you choose to navigate
- **Import/Export**: Data sharing occurs only when you actively import from or export to other apps

## Your Rights and Choices

### You Have the Right To:
- **Access**: View all data stored in the app
- **Edit**: Modify or update your saved places and information
- **Delete**: Remove individual locations or all data
- **Export**: Download your data in a portable format

### Data Retention
- Data is retained as long as you keep it in the app
- Deleted locations are permanently removed from your device
- Backup data is deleted when you disable backup or uninstall the app

## Location Services

### GPS Usage
- Location services are used only when you actively save a location
- You can deny location permission and still use the app with manual entry
- Location tracking is never continuous or background-based

### Accuracy
- We strive for accurate location data but cannot guarantee precision
- Location accuracy depends on your device's GPS capabilities

## Children's Privacy

MySpotiFIX is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

## International Users

If you are using MySpotiFIX outside your country of residence, please note that your information may be transferred to and processed in countries with different privacy laws.

## Security Approach

**MySpotiFIX is designed with privacy and security as core principles:**

- **Local-First Architecture**: Your data stays on your device, reducing exposure to external threats
- **No Central Server Dependency**: We don't maintain a central database of user locations, eliminating single points of failure
- **User-Controlled Data**: You decide what to save, share, and delete - we never access your data without your explicit action
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: With no cloud storage by default, there are fewer opportunities for unauthorized access

While we implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. However, our local-first approach significantly reduces security risks compared to cloud-based alternatives. 

In the event of a security incident:
- We will investigate immediately
- Affected users will be notified promptly
- We will take steps to prevent future incidents
- We are not liable for damages resulting from unauthorized third-party access beyond our reasonable control

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the app
- Sending a notification through the app
- Updating the "Last updated" date
